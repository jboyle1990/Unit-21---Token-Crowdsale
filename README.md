# Unit-21---Token-Crowdsale


## Compiling

The first step was to create a smart contract that defines the new KaseiCoin (KAI) as an ERC-20 token. ERC20, ERC20Detailed, and ERC20Mintable were imported from OpenZeppelin to inherit their functionality for this new smart contract. Once the contracts were written we needed to compile beforing deploying on our local blockchain.

## Deployment & Connecting Wallets

Once the smart contracts were compiled and deployed to our local blockchain via Ganache we were able to connect our wallets to test transactions.

## Testing & Transaction Verification

Once the three contracts were compiled successfully, the Crowdsale deployer contract was deployed to the Ganache local blockchain. The successful contract deployment, view of each contract, and the verification of the transaction (i.e., the smart contract deployment) are shown in the screenshots below
